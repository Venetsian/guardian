# WP-Guardian Changelog

## v1.1.0 — Telegram Interactive Commands (2026-02-25)

### New Feature: Telegram Command Handler

WP-Guardian can now receive commands via Telegram, not just send alerts. A new polling thread uses the Telegram `getUpdates` API with long-polling — no webhooks, no open ports.

**Available commands:**

- `/status` — current block counts by tier, IPs tracked, auth sessions, tripwires
- `/unblock <ip>` — remove block and reset tier to 0
- `/whitelist <ip>` — add IP to whitelist permanently
- `/whitelist <ip> <duration>` — add temporarily (e.g., `24h`, `7d`, `30d`)
- `/whitelist remove <ip>` — remove from whitelist
- `/whitelist list` — show all entries with expiry info
- `/history <ip>` — full IP history with recent block log
- `/help` — list available commands

**Security:** Only messages from the configured `chat_id` are processed. All other messages are silently ignored.

**Configuration:**

```ini
[telegram]
commands_enabled = true
commands_poll_timeout = 30
```

### Files Changed

- **Added** `actions/telegram_commands.py` — `TelegramCommander` class
- **Modified** `wp-guardian.py` — wired command handler into daemon lifecycle (init, start, shutdown)
- **Modified** `wp-guardian.conf` — added `commands_enabled` and `commands_poll_timeout` options

## v1.0.0 — Initial Public Release (2026-02-24)

### Core Features

- Real-time monitoring of web access logs (OpenLiteSpeed format), mail logs (Postfix/Dovecot), and SSH logs
- Three-tier escalation blocking: 24h (first offense) → 30d (repeat) → permanent (persistent)
- Login isolation detection — catches bots by behavioral signal (no CSS = not a browser), blocks after just 3 requests
- Tripwire-based detection from automated log analysis with incremental import
- Webshell and scanner pattern detection (alfa.php, c99.php, r57.php, etc.)
- Brute force detection for wp-login.php, xmlrpc.php, SMTP, IMAP/POP3, SSH
- CIDR /24 aggregation — auto-blocks entire subnets when 5+ IPs are individually blocked
- Domain tracking in alerts — Telegram notifications include which site was targeted
- Three-source whitelist (file + database + firewall-native friendly list)
- Authenticated IP bypass — WordPress logins grant 24h trusted status
- SQLite database with WAL mode and automated migration framework

### Pluggable Firewall Backends

- **CSF** — ConfigServer Firewall with tier-based temp/permanent blocks
- **firewalld** — Default on RHEL/AlmaLinux and CyberPanel 2.4+ (rich rules)
- **nftables** — Direct nftables with named sets and auto-expiry timeouts
- **MikroTik** — Network edge blocking via SSH with address list TTLs
- **pfSense / OPNsense** — Network edge blocking via REST API and aliases
- Extensible backend system — add new firewalls by implementing the `FirewallBackend` ABC

### Tools & Operations

- Interactive installer with firewall selection, Telegram setup, log discovery
- Telegram setup wizard with chat_id auto-discovery via bot polling
- Log discovery sub-command to find and register access logs
- Automated log analysis with incremental tripwire import (never flushes old entries)
